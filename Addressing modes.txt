implied: no addressing (1 byte)

immediate: hard-coded 1-byte number (2 bytes)

absolute: normal 2-byte addressing (3 bytes)
indexed-absolute: normal 2-byte addressing + address shifted by a register's contents 0-255 bytes (3 bytes)

zeropage: high-byte is 0x00, only low-byte is specified (2 bytes)
indexed-zeropage: high-byte is 0x00, address is the specified low-byte + shifted by a register (2 bytes)

relative: signed 1-byte address which states the offset from the current PC address between -126 and 129, used by branch instructions (2 bytes)

absolute-indirect: the actual address is fetched from the specified location, used by jump (3 bytes)
indirect-indexed: the address is fetched from the specified zeropage location (+the next), and a register's value is added to it (2 bytes)
